# Blackjack Unity Game 🎮🃏

A simple Blackjack game built in Unity using C#. You play against a computer dealer that follows classic Blackjack rules. I built it as a personal learning project.

## 🎮 Features

- Hit, Stand, double, and split - you can do everything
- The dealer plays at your command, or you can skip to the end of the hand altogether
- You start with 10,000$ and can bet on every hand - the amount is updated automatically
- Basic game logic following Blackjack rules (for instance you get 2:1 ratio when you get a blackjack)
- You can adjust the volume of the background music and sound effects, as well as the card's back color!
